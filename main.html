	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>Becoming a developer has always been a goal of mine, and the reasons behind it are rooted in both passion and practicality. First and foremost, Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by technology and how it has the power to transform the world around us. From a young age, I was captivated by the idea that coding could bring ideas to life, whether through websites, apps, or games. The process of turning abstract concepts into tangible products is something that excites me deeply.</p>
